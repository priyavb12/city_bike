Overview
Des Moines requested data for a business proposal. August 2019 Citibike data from NYC was reviewed by looking at geographical data as well as data disaggregated by user types and genders to determine if it would be a good investment for Des Moines. Other data points include usage durations, peak usage times, and the key target market.

Tableau Story

Summary:

Bike Repairs for 1/3 of the Citibikes need to be done during non-peak hours around 1-5 am. Male subscribers are the highest users and follow the traditional high use times of travel to and from work. Target market should be males needing transportation to work and weekend activities and push for subscribing to the services.

Additional Analysis:

For NYC, there were some interesting geographical areas of interest. Some trips were outside the main city center. Other areas followed the along the river. Future analysis would need to include a geographical review.

1. User Type Starting Location

User Type Starting Location Subscribers are more likely to start trip farther than the main city center of NYC than others.
